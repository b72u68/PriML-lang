# PriML-lang

This is the implementation of the PriML language. PriML is a source language for
writing fine-grained parallel programs with asynchronous computation and I/O.
It is an extension of Standard ML (and, currently, compiles to Standard ML and
uses [MLton](https://www.mlton.org) as a backend).

This repository is under construction.
More information and usage instructions coming soon.
